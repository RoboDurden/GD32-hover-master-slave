# GD32-hover-master-slave

Based on Hoverboard-Firmware-Hack-Gen2 https://github.com/flo199213/Hoverboard-Firmware-Hack-Gen2

This repository is for Makefile only. I added Makefile, Linker, startup, and Drivers for GD32.

- Makefile is ready
	
	type "make" to compile
	
	type "make flash" to compile and flash
